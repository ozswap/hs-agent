CHAPTER 74
COPPER AND ARTICLES THEREOF

74-1
Note
1. In this chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:
(a) Refined copper
Metal containing at least 99.85 percent by weight of copper; or
Metal containing at least 97.5 percent by weight of copper, provided that the content by weight of any other element does
not exceed the limit specified in the following table:
TABLE - Other elements
Element Limiting content percent by
weight
Ag Silver 0.25
As Arsenic 0.5
Cd Cadmium 1.3
Cr Chromium 1.4
Mg Magnesium 0.8
Pb Lead 1.5
S Sulfur 0.7
Sn Tin 0.8
Te Tellurium 0.8
Zn Zinc 1
Zr Zirconium 0.3
Other elements*, each 0.3
              - Other elements are, for example, Al, Be, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Si.
(b) Copper alloys
Metallic substances other than unrefined copper in which copper predominates by weight over each of the other elements,
provided that:
(i) The content by weight of at least one of the other elements is greater than the limit specified in the foregoing table; or
(ii) The total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 2.5 percent.
(c) Master alloys
Alloys containing with other elements more than 10 percent by weight of copper, not usefully malleable and commonly used
as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as deoxidants, desulfurizing agents or for similar uses in the metallurgy
of nonferrous metals. However, copper phosphide (phosphor copper) containing more than 15 percent by weight of phosphorus
falls in heading 2853.
Subheading Note
1. In this chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

74-2
Subheading Note (con.)
           (a) Copper zinc base alloys (brasses)
Alloys of copper and zinc, with or without other elements. When other elements are present:
     - zinc predominates by weight over each of such other elements;
     - any nickel content by weight is less than 5 percent (see copper-nickel-zinc alloys (nickel silvers)); and
     - any tin content by weight is less than 3 percent (see copper-tin alloys (bronzes)).
           (b) Copper tin base alloys (bronzes)
Alloys of copper and tin, with or without other elements. When other elements are present, tin predominates by weight over
each of such other elements, except that when the tin content is 3 percent or more the zinc content by weight may exceed
that of tin but must be less than 10 percent.
(c) Copper-nickel-zinc base alloys (nickel silvers)
Alloys of copper, nickel and zinc, with or without other elements. The nickel content is 5 percent or more by weight (see
copper-zinc alloys (brasses)).
           (d) Copper nickel base alloys
Alloys of copper and nickel, with or without other elements but in any case containing by weight not more than 1 percent of
zinc. When other elements are present, nickel predominates by weight over each of such other elements.
Additional U.S. Note
1. The deduction provided for in additional U.S. note 1 to chapter 26 shall apply to cement copper and copper precipitates of
subheading 7401.20.
Statistical Note
1. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "beryllium copper master alloy" refers to master alloys which contain by weight at least
3 percent but not more than 10 percent beryllium.
