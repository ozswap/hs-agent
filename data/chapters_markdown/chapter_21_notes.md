Additional U.S. Notes
1. Subheadings 2106.90.48, 2106.90.52 and 2106.90.54 cover vitamin or mineral fortified fruit or vegetable juices that are imported

(a) The term "liter" in the "Rates of Duty" column of the provisions applicable to fruit juices means liter of reconstituted fruit juice;
(b) The term "reconstituted fruit juice" means the product which can be obtained by mixing the imported concentrate with water
in such proportion that the product will have a Brix value equal to that found by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to
time to be the average Brix value of like natural unconcentrated juice in the trade and commerce of the United States; and
(c) The term "Brix value" means the refractometric sucrose value of the juice, adjusted to compensate for the effect of any added
sweetening materials, and thereafter corrected for acid.
(d) In determining the number of liters of reconstituted fruit juice which can be obtained from a concentrate, the degree of
concentration shall be calculated on a volume basis to the nearest 0.5 degree, as determined by the ratio of the Brix value
of the imported concentrated juice to that of the reconstituted juice, corrected for differences of specific gravity of the juices.
Any juice having a degree of concentration of less than 1.5 (as determined before correction to the nearest 0.5 degree) shall
be regarded as a natural unconcentrated juice; and
(e) In determining the degree of concentration of mixed fruit juices, the mixture shall be considered as being wholly of the
