metals.
XV-2
Notes (con.)

of base metals of this section if the total weight of such metals equals or exceeds the total weight of the other elements
present.
(c) In this section the term "alloys" includes sintered mixtures of metal powders, heterogeneous intimate mixtures obtained by
melting (other than cermets) and intermetallic compounds.

7. Classification of composite articles:
Except where the headings otherwise require, articles of base metal (including articles of mixed materials treated as articles of

(a) Iron and steel, or different kinds of iron or steel, are regarded as one and the same metal;
(b) An alloy is regarded as being entirely composed of that metal as an alloy of which, by virtue of note 5, it is classified; and
(c) A cermet of heading 8113 is regarded as a single base metal.
8. In this section, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:
(a) Waste and scrap
(i) All metal waste and scrap;
(ii) Metal goods definitely not usable as such because of breakage, cutting-up, wear or other reasons.
(b) Powders
Products of which 90 percent or more by weight passes through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1 mm.
9. For the purposes of chapters 74 to 76 and 78 to 81, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:
(a) Bars and rods
Rolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross section along their whole length in the
shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including “flattened circles”
and “modified rectangles”, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and
parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross section may have corners rounded along
their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including “modified rectangular”) cross section
exceeds one-tenth of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which
have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not
thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.
Wire bars and billets of chapter 74 with their ends tapered or otherwise worked simply to facilitate their entry into machines for
converting them into, for example, drawing stock (wire rod) or tubes, are however to be taken to be unwrought copper of heading
7403. This provision applies _mutatis mutandis_ to the products of chapter 81.
(b) Profiles
Rolled, extruded, drawn, forged or formed products, coiled or not, of a uniform cross section along their whole length, which do
not conform to any of the definitions of bars, rods, wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes or pipes. The expression also covers cast
or sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple
trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.
(c) Wire
Rolled, extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have a uniform solid cross section along their whole length in the shape of
circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including “flattened circles” and
“modified rectangles”, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel).
Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross section may have corners rounded along their whole
XV-3
Notes (con.)
length.The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including “modified rectangular”) cross section exceeds one-tenth
of the width.
(d) Plates, sheets, strip and foil
Flat-surfaced products (other than the unwrought products), coiled or not, of solid rectangular (other than square) cross section
with or without rounded corners (including “modified rectangles” of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides
being straight, of equal length and parallel) of a uniform thickness, which are:
-of rectangular (including square) shape with a thickness not exceeding one-tenth of the width;
-of a shape other than rectangular or square, of any size, provided that they do not assume the character of articles or products
of other headings.
Headings for plates, sheets, strip, and foil apply, _inter alia_, to plates, sheets, strip, and foil with patterns (for example, grooves,
ribs, checkers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and to such products which have been perforated, corrugated, polished or coated,
provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles or products of other headings.
(e) Tubes and pipes
Hollow products, coiled or not, which have a uniform cross section with only one enclosed void along their whole length in the
shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons, and which have a uniform
wall thickness. Products with a rectangular (including square), equilateral triangular or regular convex polygonal cross section,
which may have corners rounded along their whole length, are also to be considered as tubes and pipes provided the inner and
outer cross sections are concentric and have the same form and orientation. Tubes and pipes of the foregoing cross sections
may be polished, coated, bent, threaded, drilled, waisted, expanded, cone-shaped or fitted with flanges, collars or rings.
Additional U.S. Note
1. For the purposes of this section, the term "unwrought" refers to metal, whether or not refined, in the form of ingots, blocks, lumps,
billets, cakes, slabs, pigs, cathodes, anodes, briquettes, cubes, sticks, grains, sponge, pellets, flattened pellets, rounds, rondelles,
shot and similar manufactured primary forms, but does not cover rolled, forged, drawn or extruded products, tubular products or
cast or sintered forms which have been machined or processed otherwise than by simple trimming, scalping or descaling.

2. For the classification of ferroalloys in the subheadings of heading 7202 the following rule should be observed:
A ferroalloy is considered as binary and classified under the relevant subheading (if it exists) if only one of the alloy elements
exceeds the minimum percentage laid down in chapter note 1(c); by analogy, it is considered respectively as ternary or quaternary
if two or three alloy elements exceed the minimum percentage.
For the application of this rule, the unspecified "other elements" referred to in chapter note 1(c) must each exceed 10 percent by
weight.
