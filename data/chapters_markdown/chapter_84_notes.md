Statistical Note
1. Provisions for semiconductor manufacturing and testing machines and apparatus cover products for the growth and processing
of semiconductor materials, such as silicon and gallium arsenide, the processing of such materials into semiconductor devices
and the testing of such devices (in general the testing equipment, as well as some of the processing equipment, is classified in
chapter 90). More specifically the goods include the following:
(a) Wafer manufacturing equipment:
(i) Crystal growers & pullers - used to produce extremely pure monocrystalline semiconductor boules from which wafers
can be sliced. Most common methods employed in these crystal growers and pullers are the Czochralski and float zone
methods.
(ii) Wafer preparation equipment:
(A) Crystal grinders - used to grind the crystal boule to precise diameter required for wafers and to grind the flats on
the boule to indicate the conductivity type and resistivity of the crystal.
(B) Wafer slicing saws - used to slice wafers from a boule of monocrystalline semiconductor material.
(C) Wafer grinders, lappers and polishers - used to prepare the semiconductor wafer for the fabrication process. This
involves bringing the wafer within dimensional tolerances. Especially critical is the flatness of its surface.
XVI-3
Statistical Note (con.)
(b) Mask fabrication and repair equipment:
(i) Fabrication equipment - used to transfer design patterns to a mask or reticle, this equipment generally utilizes optical,
electron beam or X-rays to write circuit patterns on photoresist coated substrates. After development, these substrates
become the mask or reticle for wafer fabrication.
(ii) Repair equipment - this equipment generally utilizes focused ion beams or laser beams. They are used directly on the
mask or reticle to remove chrome.
(c) Wafer fabrication equipment:
(i) Film formation equipment - used to apply or produce various films on the surface of the wafer during the fabrication
process. These films serve as conductors, insulators and semiconductors on the finished device. They may include
oxides and nitrides of the substrate surface, metals, and epitaxial layers. The processes and equipments listed below
are not necessarily limited to the generation of a particular type of film.
(A) Oxidation furnaces - used to form a "film" of oxide on the wafer. The oxide is formed by the chemical reaction of the
top molecular layers of the wafer with the applied oxygen or steam under heat.
(B) Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) equipment - used to deposit various types of films which are obtained by combining
the appropriate gases in a reactant chamber at elevated temperatures.This constitutes a thermochemical vapor-phase
reaction. Operations may take place at atmospheric or low pressure (LPCVD) and may use plasma enhancement
(PECVD).
(C) Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) equipment - used to deposit various types of films which are obtained by vaporizing
a solid.
(1) Evaporation equipment - in which the film is generated by heating the source material.
(2) Sputtering equipment - in which the film is generated by bombarding the source material (target) with ions.
(D) Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) equipment - used to grow epitaxial layers on a heated monocrystalline substrate in
an ultrahigh vacuum using beams of molecules. The process is similar to PVD.
(ii) Doping equipment - which is used to introduce dopants into the wafer surface in order to modify the conductivity or other
characteristics of a semiconductor layer:
(A) Thermal diffusion equipment - in which the dopants are introduced into the surface of the wafer by the application
of gases under high temperatures.
(B) Ion Implantation - in which the dopants are "driven" into the crystal lattice structure of the surface of the wafer in the
form of a beam of accelerated ions.
(C) Annealing furnaces - which are used to repair the crystal lattice structures of the wafer damaged by ion implantation.
(iii) Etching and stripping equipment - used for etching or cleaning surfaces of the wafers.
(A) Wet etching equipment - in which chemical etching materials are applied by spraying or immersion. Spray etchers
provide more uniform results than bath etchers, since they perform the operation on one wafer at a time.
(B) Dry plasma etching - in which etching materials are presented as gases within a plasma energy field, providing an
anisotropic etch profile.
(C) Ion beam milling equipment - in which ionized gas atoms are accelerated toward the wafer surface. The impact
results in the top layer being physically removed from the surface.
(D) Strippers or ashers - using techniques similar to etching, this apparatus removes the spent photoresist from the
surface of the wafer after it has served its purpose as a "stencil".This equipment is also used for removal of nitrides,
oxides, and polysilicon, with an isotropic etch profile.
(iv) Lithography equipment - used to transfer the circuit designs to the photoresist coated surface of the semiconductor
wafer.
(A) Equipment for coating wafers with photoresist - these include the photoresist spinners which are used to apply liquid
photoresist evenly over the surface of the wafer.
XVI-4
Statistical Note (con.)
(B) Equipment for exposing the photoresist coated wafer with the circuit design (or a part thereof):
(1) Using a mask or reticle and exposing the photoresist to light (generally ultraviolet) or, in some instances, X-rays:
(a) Contact printers - where the mask or reticle is in contact with the wafer during exposure.
(b) Proximity aligners - similar to contact aligners except actual contact does not take place between the mask
or reticle and the wafer.
(c) Scanning aligners - which use projection techniques to expose a continuously moving slit across the mask
and wafer.
(d) Step and repeat aligners - which use projection techniques to expose the wafer a portion at a time. Exposure
can be by reduction from the mask to the wafer or 1:1. Enhancements include the use of an excimer laser.
(2) Direct write on wafer equipment - these apparatus operate with no mask or reticle.They use a computer controlled
"writing beam" (such as an electron beam (E-beam), ion beam or laser) to "draw" the circuit design directly on
the photoresist coated wafer.
(C) Equipment for developing exposed wafers - these include chemical baths similar to those used in photographic
laboratory applications.
(d) Assembly equipment:
(i) Dicing equipment - these include sawing machines and scribing machines (including laser scribers) and dicing accessories
such as wafer breaking equipment.
(ii) Die bonding equipment - which installs the die to the package by soldering or gluing
(iii) Wire bonding equipment - used for attaching thin wires or tapes (usually of gold, aluminum or copper) from the die
bonding pads to the corresponding pads on the package.
(iv) Packaging equipment - which are used to encapsulate or package a semiconductor device.They include sealing furnaces,
lid welders, plastic encapsulation presses, lead trim and form equipment, package deflashers, and tin dip and solder
plate equipment.
(e) Testing and inspection equipment:
(i) Optical inspection equipment - These include equipment that "examines" portions of the wafer surface and compares
them either to a standard pattern or to other portions of the wafer surface.
(ii) Electrical testing equipment - These include computer controlled systems that test the functions and electrical specifications
of semiconductor devices through the application and detection of electrical signals or patterns. Testing is performed
on both unencapsulated dice and packaged integrated circuits.
