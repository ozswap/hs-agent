CHAPTER 70
GLASS AND GLASSWARE
XIII
70-1
Notes
1. This chapter does not cover:
(a) Goods of heading 3207 (for example, vitrifiable enamels and glazes, glass frit, other glass in the form of powder, granules
or flakes);
(b) Articles of chapter 71 (for example, imitation jewelry);
(c) Optical fiber cables of heading 8544, electrical insulators (heading 8546) or fittings of insulating material of heading 8547;
(d) Front windscreens (windshields), rear windows and other windows, framed, for vehicles of chapters 86 to 88;
(e) Front windscreens (windshields), rear windows and other windows, whether or not framed, incorporating heating devices or
other electrical or electronic devices, for vehicles of chapters 86 to 88;
(f) Optical fibers, optically worked optical elements, hypodermic syringes, artificial eyes, thermometers, barometers, hydrometers
or other articles of chapter 90;
(g) Luminaires or lighting fittings, illuminated signs, illuminated name-plates or the like, having a permanently fixed light source,
or parts thereof of heading 9405;
(h) Toys, games, sports equipment, Christmas tree ornaments or other articles of chapter 95 (excluding glass eyes without
mechanisms for dolls or for other articles of chapter 95); or
(ij) Buttons, fitted vacuum flasks, scent or similar sprays or other articles of chapter 96.
2. For the purposes of headings 7003, 7004 and 7005:
(a) Glass is not regarded as "worked" by reason of any process it has undergone before annealing;
(b) Cutting to shape does not affect the classification of glass in sheets;
                                    (c) The expression "absorbent, reflecting or non reflecting layer" means a microscopically thin coating of metal or of a chemical
compound (for example, metal oxide) which absorbs, for example, infrared light; or which improves the reflecting qualities
of the glass while still allowing it to retain a degree of transparency or translucency; or which prevents light from being
reflected on the surface of the glass.
3. The products referred to in heading 7006 remain classified in that heading whether or not they have the character of articles.
4. For the purposes of heading 7019, the expression "glass wool" means:
(a) Mineral wools with a silica (SiO 2 ) content not less than 60 percent by weight;
(b) Mineral wools with a silica (SiO 2 ) content less than 60 percent but with an alkaline oxide (K 2 O or Na 2 O) content exceeding
5 percent by weight or a borix oxide (B 2 O 3 ) content exceeding 2 percent by weight.
Mineral wools which do not comply with the above specifications fall in heading 6806.
5. Throughout the tariff schedule, the expression "glass" includes fused quartz and other fused silica.
Subheading Note
1. For the purposes of subheadings 7013.22, 7013.33, 7013.41 and 7013.91, the expression "lead crystal" means only glass having
a minimum lead monoxide (PbO) content by weight of 24 percent.

70-2
Additional U.S. Notes
1. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "fused quartz or other fused silica" means glass containing more than 95 percent silica
by weight.
2. For the purposes of headings 7003 through 7005, the expression "colored throughout the mass" refers to glass that has a
transmittance of normally incident light of less than 66 percent at one or more wavelengths from 400 to 700 millimicrons, inclusive,
or a transmittance of less than 80 percent at one or more wavelengths from 525 to 575 millimicrons, inclusive, for glass 6 mm
in thickness, or of the equivalent transmittances for any other thickness, provided that, in determining such light transmittances,
the effect of surface irregularities or configurations, or of other surface treatment (except flashing applied prior to solidification)
and the effect of wire netting within the glass, shall be eliminated.
3. For the purposes of headings 7003 and 7004, glass of the same size and thickness imported in any shipment in quantities over
4.6 m 2 shall be denied entry unless it is-
(a) Packed in units containing, as nearly as the particular size permits, 4.6 m 2, or multiples thereof; or
(b) Packed in units containing multiples of the number of sheets of the same size and thickness which would be contained in a
2
unit if packed to contain, as nearly as such size permits, 4.6 or 9.3 m ; or
(c) Otherwise packed in a manner which conforms to the packing practices of the domestic glass industry as determined and
published from time to time by the Secretary of the Treasury.
4. For the purposes of heading 7005, the expression "polished," as used with reference to glass, refers to glass one or both of the
surfaces of which have been made smooth and glossy, in whole or in part, by abrasive or chemical means or by floating the
glass over molten metal.
5. For the purposes of subheading 7018.10.20, the term "imitation precious or semiprecious stones" means glass made into shapes
suitable for use in jewelry or for other ornamental purposes in a manner similar to natural gemstones, whether or not in imitation
thereof, but does not include natural gemstones, synthetic gemstones, reconstructed natural gemstones or imitation pearls.
Statistical Notes
1. For the purposes of headings 7003 and 7004, in determining the surface area of cast or rolled glass having irregular surfaces
(such as corrugated glass), superficial area shall be used.
2. For the purposes of statistical reporting numbers 7009.91.5091 and 7009.92.5091, “over-the-door mirrors” means mirrors designed
to be affixed to a door or hung from the top of a door by means of hooks which are either attached to or packaged with such
mirrors at the time of importation. Brackets or other hardware may also be attached to these mirrors or included in the packaging.
