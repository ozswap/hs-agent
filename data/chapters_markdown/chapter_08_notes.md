Notes
1. This chapter does not cover inedible nuts or fruit.
2. Chilled fruit and nuts are to be classified in the same headings as the corresponding fresh fruit and nuts.
3. Dried fruit or dried nuts of this chapter may be partially rehydrated, or treated for the following purposes:
(a) For additional preservation or stabilization (for example, by moderate heat treatment, sulfuring, the addition of sorbic acid
or potassium sorbate),
(b) To improve or maintain their appearance (for example, by the addition of vegetable oil or small quantities of glucose syrup),
provided that they retain the character of dried fruits or dried nuts.
4. Heading 0812 applies to fruit and nuts which have been treated solely to ensure their provisional preservation during transport
or storage prior to use (for example, by sulfur dioxide gas, in brine, in sulfur water or in other preservative solutions), provided
they remain unsuitable for immediate consumption in that state.
