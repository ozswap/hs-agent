Additional U.S. Notes
1. For the purposes of determining the classification of printed matter produced in whole or in part by a lithographic process, the
thickness of such printed matter is that of the thinnest paper contained therein, except that the thickness of a permanently
mounted lithograph is the combined thickness of the lithograph and its mounting.
2. Currency in current circulation in any country imported for monetary purposes and securities and similar evidences of value
provided for in heading 4907 shall be admitted without formal customs consumption entry or the payment of duty. This does not
affect any requirement under other provisions of law to the effect that transfers of monetary instruments into or through the United
States, in an amount exceeding $10,000 on any one occasion, shall be reported as prescribed therein.
