5. For the purposes of heading 2007, the expression " obtained by cooking" means obtained by heat treatment at atmospheric
pressure or under reduced pressure to increase the viscosity of a product through reduction of water content or other means.
6. For the purposes of heading 2009 the expression "juices, unfermented and not containing added spirit" means juices of an
alcoholic strength by volume (see note 2 to chapter 22) not exceeding 0.5 percent vol.
Subheading Notes
1. For the purposes of subheading 2005.10, the expression "homogenized vegetables" means preparations of vegetables, finely
homogenized, put up for retail sale as food suitable for infants or young children or for dietetic purposes, in containers of a net
weight content not exceeding 250 g. For the application of this definition no account is to be taken of small quantities of any
ingredients which may have been added to the preparation for seasoning, preservation or other purposes. These preparations
may contain a small quantity of visible pieces of vegetables. Subheading 2005.10 takes precedence over all other subheadings
of heading 2005.
2. For the purposes of subheading 2007.10, the expression "homogenized preparations" means preparations of fruit, finely
homogenized, put up for retail sale as food suitable for infants or young children or for dietetic purposes, in containers of a net
weight content not exceeding 250 g. For the application of this definition no account is to be taken of small quantities of any
ingredients which may have been added to the preparation for seasoning, preservation or other purposes. These preparations
may contain a small quantity of visible pieces of fruit. Subheading 2007.10 takes precedence over all other subheadings of
heading 2007.
3. For the purposes of subheadings 2009.12, 2009.21, 2009.31, 2009.41, 2009.61 and 2009.71, the expression " Brix value" means
the direct reading of degrees Brix obtained from a Brix hydrometer or of refractive index expressed in terms of percentage sucrose
content obtained from a refractometer, at a temperature of 20 °C or corrected for 20 °C if the reading is made at a different
temperature.
Additional U.S. Notes
1. For the purposes of heading 2009:
(a) The term "liter" in the "Rates of Duty" column of the provisions applicable to fruit juices means liter of natural unconcentrated
fruit juice or liter of reconstituted fruit juice;

Additional U.S. Notes (con.)
(b) The term "reconstituted fruit juice" means the product which can be obtained by mixing the imported concentrate with water in
such proportion that the product will have a Brix value equal to that found by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time to
be the average Brix value of like natural unconcentrated juice in the trade and commerce of the United States; and
(c) The term "Brix value" means the refractometric sucrose value of the juice, adjusted to compensate for the effect of any added
sweetening materials, and thereafter corrected for acid.
2. In determining the number of liters of reconstituted fruit juice which can be obtained from a concentrate, the degree of concentration
shall be calculated on a volume basis to the nearest 0.5 degree, as determined by the ratio of the Brix value of the imported
concentrated juice to that of the reconstituted juice, corrected for differences of specific gravity of the juices. Any juice having a
degree of concentration of less than 1.5 (as determined before correction to the nearest 0.5 degree) shall be regarded as a natural
unconcentrated juice.
3. In determining the degree of concentration of mixed fruit juices, the mixture shall be considered as being wholly of the component
juice having the lowest Brix value.
4. The aggregate quantity of olives entered under subheadings 0711.20.18 and 2005.70.06 in any calendar year shall not exceed
4,400 metric tons.
5. The aggregate quantity of peanut butter and paste entered under subheading 2008.11.05 in any calendar year shall not exceed the
quantities specified in this note (articles the product of Mexico shall not be permitted or included under the aforementioned quantitative
limitation and no such articles shall be classifiable therein).
