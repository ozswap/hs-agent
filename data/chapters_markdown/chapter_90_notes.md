(ij) Searchlights or spotlights of heading 9405;
(k) Articles of chapter 95;
(l) Monopods, bipods, tripods and similar articles, of heading 9620;
(m) Capacity measures, which are to be classified according to their constituent material; or
(n) Spools, reels or similar supports (which are to be classified according to their constituent material, for example, in heading
3923 or section XV).
2. Subject to note 1 above, parts and accessories for machines, apparatus, instruments or articles of this chapter are to be classified
according to the following rules:
(a) Parts and accessories which are goods included in any of the headings of this chapter or of chapter 84, 85 or 91 (other than
heading 8487, 8548 or 9033) are in all cases to be classified in their respective headings;
(b) Other parts and accessories, if suitable for use solely or principally with a particular kind of machine, instrument or apparatus,
or with a number of machines, instruments or apparatus of the same heading (including a machine, instrument or apparatus
of heading 9010, 9013 or 9031) are to be classified with the machines, instruments or apparatus of that kind;
(c) All other parts and accessories are to be classified in heading 9033.

Notes (con.)
3. The provisions of notes 3 and 4 to section XVI apply also to this chapter.
4. Heading 9005 does not apply to telescopic sights for fitting to arms, periscopic telescopes for fitting to submarines or tanks, or
to telescopes for machines, appliances, instruments or apparatus of this chapter or section XVI; such telescopic sights and
telescopes are to be classified in heading 9013.
5. Measuring or checking optical instruments, appliances or machines which, but for this note, could be classified both in heading
9013 and in heading 9031 are to be classified in heading 9031.
6. For the purposes of heading 9021, the expression “orthopedic appliances” means appliances for:
(a) Preventing or correcting bodily deformities; or
(b) Supporting or holding parts of the body following an illness, operation or injury.
Orthopedic appliances include footwear and special insoles designed to correct orthopedic conditions, provided that they are
either (1) made to measure or (2) mass-produced, entered singly and not in pairs and designed to fit either foot equally.
7. Heading 9032 applies only to:
(a) Instruments and apparatus for automatically controlling the flow, level, pressure or other variables of liquids or gases, or for
automatically controlling temperature, whether or not their operation depends on an electrical phenomenon which varies
according to the factor to be automatically controlled, which are designed to bring this factor to, and maintain it at, a desired
value, stabilized against disturbances, by constantly or periodically measuring its actual value; and
(b) Automatic regulators of electrical quantities, and instruments or apparatus for automatically controlling non-electrical quantities
the operation of which depends on an electrical phenomenon varying according to the factor to be controlled, which are
designed to bring this factor to, and maintain it at, a desired value, stabilized against disturbances, by constantly or periodically
measuring its actual value.
Additional U.S. Notes
1. For the purposes of headings 9001 and 9002, the term "optically worked" refers to glass the surface of which has been ground
or polished in order to produce the required optical properties.
2. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "electrical" when used in reference to instruments, appliances, apparatus and machines,
refers to those articles the operation of which depends on an electrical phenomenon which varies according to the factor to be
ascertained.
3. For the purposes of this chapter, the terms "optical appliances"and"optical instruments" refer only to those appliances and
instruments which incorporate one or more optical elements, but do not include any appliances or instruments in which the
incorporated optical element or elements are solely for viewing a scale or for some other subsidiary purpose.
4. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "printed circuit assembly"means goods consisting of one or more printed circuits of
heading 8534 with one or more active elements assembled thereon, with or without passive elements. For the purposes of this
note,"active elements" means diodes, transistors and similar semiconductor devices, whether or not photosensitive, of heading
8541, and integrated circuits of heading 8542.
Statistical Notes
1. For statistical reporting purposes under subheading 9001.10, the unit of quantity "fiber m", as it pertains to optical fiber bundles
and cables, is determined by multiplying the number of individual fibers contained therein by the length in meters.
2. For the purposes of statistical reporting number 9025.19.8010, “clinical infrared thermometers” are devices designed to be used
to check the body temperatures of humans and animals.
