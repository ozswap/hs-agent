of law and shall be seized and forfeited under the customs laws unless such presumption is satisfactorily rebutted; except
that such presumption shall not apply to articles in actual use for personal adornment or for scientific or educational purposes.
Any article so forfeited may (in the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury and under such regulations as he may prescribe)
(1) be placed with any agency of the Federal Government or of any State government, or any society or museum for exhibition
or scientific or educational purposes, or (2) be destroyed.

act of July 3, 1918 (40 Stat. 755), or any other law of the United States, now of force, intended for the protection or preservation
of birds within the United States. If on investigation by the district director of Customs before seizure, or before trial for
forfeiture, or if at such trial if such seizure has been made, it shall be made to appear to the district director of Customs, or
to the prosecuting officer of the Government, as the case may be, that no illegal importation of such feathers has been made,
but that the possession, acquisition or purchase of such feathers is or has been made in violation of the provisions of the
act of March 4, 1913, chapter 145 (37 Stat. 847), or the act of July 3, 1918 (40 Stat. 755), or any other law of the United
States, now of force, intended for the protection or preservation of birds within the United States, it shall be the duty of the
district director of Customs, or such prosecuting officer, as the case may be, to report the facts to the proper officials of the
United States, or State or Territory charged with the duty of enforcing such laws.
