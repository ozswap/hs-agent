Notes
1. This chapter does not cover:
(a) Separate chemically defined organic compounds, other than pure methane and propane which are to be classified in heading
2711;
(b) Medicaments of heading 3003 or 3004; or
(c) Mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons of heading 3301, 3302 or 3805.
2. References in heading 2710 to "petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals" include not only petroleum oils and
oils obtained from bituminous minerals, but also similar oils, as well as those consisting mainly of mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons,
obtained by any process, provided that the weight of the nonaromatic constituents exceeds that of the aromatic constituents.
However, the references do not include liquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60 percent by volume distills at 300˚C, after
conversion to 1,013 millibars when a reduced-pressure distillation method is used (chapter 39).
3. For the purposes of heading 2710, "waste oils" means waste containing mainly petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous
minerals (as described in note 2 to this chapter), whether or not mixed with water. These include:
(a) Such oils no longer fit for use as primary products (for example, used lubricating oils, used hydraulic oils and used transformer
oils);
(b) Sludge oils from the storage tanks of petroleum oils, mainly containing such oils and a high concentration of additives (for
example, chemicals) used in the manufacture of the primary products; and
(c) Such oils in the form of emulsions in water or mixtures with water, such as those resulting from oil spills, storage tank
washings, or from the use of cutting oils for machining operations.
Subheading Notes
1. For the purposes of subheading 2701.11, "anthracite" means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, mineral-matter-free
basis) not exceeding 14 percent.
2. For the purposes of subheading 2701.12, "bituminous coal" means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, mineral-matter-free
basis) exceeding 14 percent and a calorific value limit (on a moist, mineral-matter-free basis) equal to or greater than 5,833
kcal/kg.
3. For the purposes of subheadings 2707.10, 2707.20, 2707.30, 2707.40, the terms "benzol (benzene)", "toluol (toluene)", "xylol
(xylenes)" and "naphthalene" apply to products which contain more than 50 percent by weight of benzene, toluene, xylenes or
naphthalene, respectively.
4. For the purposes of subheading 2710.12, "light oils and preparations" are those of which 90 percent or more by volume (including
losses) distill at 210˚C according to the ISO 3405 method (equivalent to the ASTM D 86 method).
5. For the purposes of the subheadings of heading 2710, the term “biodiesel” means mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids of a kind used
as a fuel, derived from animal, vegetable or microbial fats and oils whether or not used.
Additional U.S. Notes
1. (a) Crude petroleum oils, crude oils obtained from bituminous minerals and reconstituted crude petroleum shall, if products of
Canada, be admitted free of duty and any entry therefor shall be liquidated or reliquidated accordingly if, on or before the
180th day after the date of entry, documentation is filed with the customs officer concerned establishing that, pursuant to a
commercial exchange agreement between the United States and Canadian refiners which has been approved by the Secretary
of Energy-
(i) An import license for the products covered by such entry has been issued by the Secretary; and

Additional U.S. Notes (con.)
(ii) An equivalent amount of domestic or duty-paid foreign crude petroleum oils, crude oils obtained from bituminous minerals
or reconstituted crude petroleum have, pursuant to such commercial exchange agreement and to an export license
issued by the Secretary of Commerce, been exported from the United States to Canada and have not previously been
used to effect the duty-free entry of like Canadian products under this U.S. note.
(b) The Secretary of the Treasury, after consulting with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy, shall issue
such rules or regulations as may be necessary governing the admission of Canadian products pursuant to the provisions of
this U.S. note.
2. For the purposes of heading 2710, "petroleum oils" includes only products having:
(a) A Congealing Point (ASTM D 938) of less than 30˚C;
(b) If the Congealing Point is not less than 30˚C:
(i) A density at 70˚C of less than 0.942 and a Worked Cone Penetration (ASTM D 217) or a Cone Penetration or (ASTM
D 937) at 25˚C of not less than 350; or
(ii) If the density at 70˚C is not less than 0.942 having a Needle Penetration (ASTM D 5) at 25˚C of not less than 400.
3. For the purposes of subheading 2710.12.15, "motor fuel" is any product derived primarily from petroleum, shale or natural gas,
whether or not containing additives, which is principally used as a fuel in internal-combustion or other engines.
4. For the purposes of subheadings 2710.12.18, 2710.19.25 and 2710.20.15, "motor fuel blending stock" means any product (except
naphthas of subheading 2710.12.25) derived primarily from petroleum, shale oil or natural gas, whether or not containing additives,
to be used for direct blending in the manufacture of motor fuel.
5. In determining the relative weights of components of the mixtures provided for in subheadings 2710.12.45 and 2710.19.45,
naphtha and other petroleum derivatives which may be present in such mixtures as solvents shall be disregarded.
6. For the purposes of heading 2716:
(a) The term "electrical energy" does not include electrical energy transmitted as a medium of communication; and
(b) Electrical energy shall not be subject to the entry requirements for imported merchandise set forth in section 484 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended, (19 U.S.C. 1484), but shall be entered on a periodic basis in accordance with regulations to be
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
7. For the purposes of this chapter, the term barrel (bbl) means a barrel of 158.98 liters measured at 15.6˚C.
8. Subheading 2712.10.00 does not include petroleum jelly, suitable for use for the care of the skin, put up in packings of a kind
sold at retail for such use (subheading 3304.99.10).
