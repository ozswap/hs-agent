(l) Articles of chapter 64 or chapter 65;
(m) Abrasive paper or paperboard (heading 6805) or paper- or paperboard-backed mica (heading 6814) (paper and paperboard
coated with mica powder are, however, to be classified in this chapter);
(n) Metal foil backed with paper or paperboard (generally section XIV or XV);
(o) Articles of heading 9209;
(p) Articles of chapter 95 (for example, toys, games, sports requisites); or
(q) Articles of chapter 96 (for example, buttons, sanitary pads (towels) and tampons, diapers (napkins) and diaper liners).
3. Subject to the provisions of note 7, headings 4801 to 4805 include paper and paperboard which have been subjected to
calendering, super-calendering, glazing or similar finishing, false water-marking or surface sizing, and also paper, paperboard,
cellulose wadding and webs of cellulose fibers, colored or marbled throughout the mass by any method. Except where heading
4803 otherwise requires, these headings do not apply to paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding or webs of cellulose fibers which
have been otherwise processed.
4. In this chapter, the expression "newsprint" means uncoated paper of a kind used for the printing of newspapers, of which not
less than 50 percent by weight of the total fiber content consists of wood fibers obtained by a mechanical or chemi-mechanical
process, unsized or very lightly sized, having a surface roughness Parker Print Surf (1 MPa) on each side exceeding 2.5
micrometers (microns), weighing not less than 40 g/m 2 and not more than 65 g/m 2, and applies only to paper: (a) in strips or rolls
of a width exceeding 28 cm; or (b) in rectangular (including square) sheets with one side exceeding 28 cm and the other side
exceeding 15 cm in the unfolded state.

5. For the purposes of heading 4802, the expressions "paper and paperboard, of a kind used for writing, printing or other graphic
purposes" and "nonperforated punch-cards and punch tape paper" mean paper and paperboard made mainly from bleached
pulp or from pulp obtained by a mechanical or chemi-mechanical process and satisfying any of the following criteria:
2
(A) For paper or paperboard weighing not more than 150 g/m :
(a) Containing 10% or more of fibers obtained by a mechanical or chemi-mechanical process, and
1. 2
weighing not more than 80 g/m, or
2. colored throughout the mass; or
(b) Containing more than 8 percent ash, and
1. 2
weighing not more than 80 g/m, or
2. colored throughout the mass; or
(c) Containing more than 3 percent ash and having a brightness of 60 percent or more; or
(d) Containing more than 3 percent but not more than 8 percent ash, having a brightness less than 60 percent and a burst
index equal to or less than 2.5 kPa·m 2 /g; or
(e) Containing 3 percent ash or less, having a brightness of 60 percent or more and a burst index equal to or less than 2.5
kPa·m 2 /g.
2
(B) For paper or paperboard weighing more than 150 g/m :
(a) Colored throughout the mass; or
(b) Having a brightness of 60 percent or more, and
1. a caliper of 225 micrometers (microns) or less, or
2. a caliper of more than 225 micrometers (microns) but not more than 508 micrometers (microns) and an ash content
of more than 3 percent; or
(c) Having a brightness of less than 60 percent, a caliper of 254 micrometers (microns) or less and an ash content of more
than 8 percent.
Heading 4802 does not, however, cover filter paper or paperboard (including teabag paper) or felt paper or paperboard.
6. In this chapter "kraft paper and paperboard" means paper and paperboard of which not less than 80 percent by weight of the
total fiber content consists of fibers obtained by the chemical sulfate or soda processes.
7. Except where the terms of the headings otherwise require, paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding and webs of cellulose fibers
answering to a description in two or more of the headings 4801 to 4811 are to be classified under that one of such headings
which occurs last in numerical order in the tariff schedule.
8. Headings 4803 to 4809 apply only to paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding and webs of cellulose fibers:
(a) In strips or rolls of a width exceeding 36 cm; or
(b) In rectangular (including square) sheets with one side exceeding 36 cm and the other side exceeding 15 cm in the unfolded
state.
9. For the purposes of heading 4814, the expression "wallpaper and similar wall coverings" applies only to:
(a) Paper in rolls, of a width of not less than 45 cm and not more than 160 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration:
(i) Grained, embossed, surface-colored, design-printed or otherwise surface-decorated (for example, with textile flock),
whether or not coated or covered with transparent protective plastics;
(ii) With an uneven surface resulting from the incorporation of particles of wood, straw, etc.;

(iii) Coated or covered on the face side with plastics, the layer of plastics being grained, embossed, colored, design-printed
or otherwise decorated; or
(iv) Covered on the face side with plaiting material, whether or not bound together in parallel strands or woven;
(b) Borders and friezes of paper, treated as above, whether or not in rolls, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration;
(c) Wall coverings of paper made up of several panels, in rolls or sheets, printed so as to make up a scene, design or motif

Products on a base of paper or paperboard, suitable for use both as floor coverings and as wall coverings, are to be classified
in heading 4823.
10. Heading 4820 does not cover loose sheets or cards, cut to size, whether or not printed, embossed or perforated.
11. Heading 4823 applies, inter alia, to perforated paper or paperboard cards for Jacquard or similar machines and paper lace.
12. Except for the articles of heading 4814 or 4821, paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding and articles thereof, printed with motifs,
characters or pictorial representations, which are not merely subsidiary to the primary use of the goods, fall in chapter 49.
