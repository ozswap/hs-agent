and in no other heading of the tariff schedule.
(b) Subject to paragraph (a) above, goods answering to a description in heading 2843, 2846 or 2852 are to be classified in those
headings and in no other heading of this section.

of the tariff schedule.
3. Goods put up in sets consisting of two or more separate constituents, some or all of which fall in this section and are intended
to be mixed together to obtain a product of section VI or VII, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to that product,
provided that the constituents are:
(a) Having regard to the manner in which they are put up, clearly identifiable as being intended to be used together without first
being repacked;
(b) Entered together; and
(c) Identifiable, whether by their nature or by the relative proportions in which they are present, as being complementary one
to another.
4. Where a product answers to a description in one or more of the headings in section VI by virtue of being described by name or
function and also to heading 3827, then it is classifiable in a heading that references the product by name or function and not
under heading 3827.
Additional U.S. Notes
1. In determining the amount of duty applicable to a solution of a single compound in water subject to duty in this section at a specific
rate, an allowance in weight or volume, as the case may be, shall be made for the water in excess of any water of crystallization
which may be present in the undissolved compound.
2. For the purposes of the tariff schedule:
(a) The term "aromatic" as applied to any chemical compound refers to such compound containing one or more fused or unfused
benzene rings;
(b) The term "modified aromatic" describes a molecular structure having at least one six-membered heterocyclic ring which
contains at least four carbon atoms and having an arrangement of molecular bonds as in the benzene ring or in the quinone
ring, but does not include any such molecular structure in which one or more pyrimidine rings are the only modified aromatic
rings present;
(c) For the purposes of headings 2902, 2907 and 3817, the term "alkyl" describes any saturated acyclic hydrocarbon group
having six or more carbon atoms or, subject to note 1 to chapter 29, any mixtures of such groups averaging six or more
carbon atoms.
3. The term "products described in additional U.S. note 3 to section VI" refers to any product not listed in the Chemical Appendix
to the Tariff Schedule and-
(a) For which the importer furnishes the Chemical Abstracts Service (C.A.S.) registry number and certifies that such registry
number is not listed in the Chemical Appendix to the Tariff Schedule; or
(b) Which the importer certifies not to have a C.A.S. registry number and not to be listed in the Chemical Appendix to the Tariff
Schedule, either under the name used to make Customs entry or under any other name by which it may be known.

Notes
1. Except where the context otherwise requires, the headings of this chapter apply only to:
(a) Separate chemical elements and separate chemically defined compounds, whether or not containing impurities;
(b) The products mentioned in (a) above dissolved in water;
(c) The products mentioned in (a) above dissolved in other solvents provided that the solution constitutes a normal and necessary
method of putting up these products adopted solely for reasons of safety or for transport and that the solvent does not render
the product particularly suitable for specific use rather than for general use;
(d) The products mentioned in (a), (b) or (c) above with an added stabilizer (including an anticaking agent) necessary for their
preservation or transport;
(e) The products mentioned in (a), (b), (c) or (d) above with an added antidusting agent or a coloring substance added to facilitate
their identification or for safety reasons, provided that the additions do not render the product particularly suitable for specific
use rather than for general use.
2. In addition to dithionites and sulfoxylates, stabilized with organic substances (heading 2831), carbonates and peroxocarbonates
of inorganic bases (heading 2836), cyanides, cyanide oxides and complex cyanides of inorganic bases (heading 2837), fulminates,
cyanates and thiocyanates, of inorganic bases (heading 2842), organic products included in headings 2843 to 2846 and 2852
and carbides (heading 2849), only the following compounds of carbon are to be classified in this chapter:
