by weight. Such pellets are cylindrical, with a diameter not exceeding 25 mm and a length not exceeding 100 mm.
2. For the purposes of subheading 4401.32, the expression "wood briquettes" means by-products such as cutter shavings, sawdust
or chips, of the mechanical wood processing industry, furniture making or other wood transformation activities, which have been
agglomerated either directly by compression or by the addition of a binder in a proportion not exceeding 3 percent by weight.
Such briquettes are in the form of cubiform, polyhedral or cylindrical units with the minimum cross-sectional dimension greater
than 25 mm.

of residual wood such as slabs, edgings, cull pieces and veneer log cores;
(b) The term "standard wood moldings" means wood moldings worked to a pattern and having the same profile in cross section
throughout their length; and
(c) The term "surface covered," as applied to the articles of headings 4411 and 4412, means that one or more exterior surfaces
of a product have been treated with creosote or other wood preservatives, or with fillers, sealers, waxes, oils, stains, varnishes,
