2. The term "felt" includes needleloom felt and fabrics consisting of a web of textile fibers the cohesion of which has been enhanced
by a stitch-bonding process using fibers from the web itself.
3. Headings 5602 and 5603 cover respectively felt and nonwovens, impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with plastics or
rubber whatever the nature of these materials (compact or cellular).
Heading 5603 also includes nonwovens in which plastics or rubber forms the bonding substance.
Headings 5602 and 5603 do not, however, cover:
(a) Felt impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with plastics or rubber, containing 50 percent or less by weight of textile
material or felt completely embedded in plastics or rubber (chapter 39 or 40);
(b) Nonwovens, either completely embedded in plastics or rubber, or entirely coated or covered on both sides with such materials,
provided that such coating or covering can be seen with the naked eye with no account being taken of any resulting change
of color (chapter 39 or 40); or
(c) Plates, sheets or strip of cellular plastics or cellular rubber combined with felt or nonwovens, where the textile material is
present merely for reinforcing purposes (chapter 39 or 40).
4. Heading 5604 does not cover textile yarn, or strip or the like of heading 5404 or 5405, in which the impregnation, coating or
covering cannot be seen with the naked eye (usually chapters 50 to 55); for the purpose of this provision, no account should be
taken of any resulting change of color.
