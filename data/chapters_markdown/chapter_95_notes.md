Statistical note
1. In heading 9503, classification is based on the youngest age for which the product is intended. For example, an item labeled
"For ages 2–5" would be appropriately classified in the "Under 3 years of age" category. Parts and accessories, if not specifically
labeled for a specific age, should be classified under the age designation that would be applicable to the finished retail product
of which it is a component or in which it is incorporated.
