XI-6
Subheading Notes (con.)
2. (A) Products of chapters 56 to 63 containing two or more textile materials are to be regarded as consisting wholly of that textile
material which would be selected under note 2 to this section for the classification of a product of chapters 50 to 55 or of
heading 5809 consisting of the same textile materials.
(B) For the application of this rule:
(a) Where appropriate, only the part which determines the classification under general interpretative rule 3 shall be taken
into account;
(b) In the case of textile products consisting of a ground fabric and a pile or looped surface no account shall be taken of the
ground fabric;
(c) In the case of embroidery of heading 5810 and goods thereof, only the ground fabric shall be taken into account. However,
embroidery without visible ground, and goods thereof, shall be classified with reference to the embroidering threads
alone.
Additional U.S. Notes
1. In the case of each provision in the tariff schedule on which the United States has agreed to reduce the rate of duty, pursuant
to a trade agreement entered into under section 101 of the Trade Act of 1974 before January 3, 1980, on any cotton, wool or
man-made fiber textile product as defined in the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles, as extended on December
14, 1977 (the Arrangement), if the Arrangement, or a substitute arrangement, including unilateral import restrictions or bilateral
agreements, determined by the President to be suitable, ceases to be in effect with respect to the United States before the total
reduction in the rate of duty for such provision under sections 101 and 109 of the Trade Act of 1974 has become effective, then
the President shall proclaim the rate of duty in rate column 1 for such provision existing on January 1, 1975, to be the rate of
duty effective, with respect to articles entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, within 30 days after such cessation
and until the President proclaims the continuation of such reduction under the next sentence. If subsequently the Arrangement
or a substitute arrangement, including unilateral import restrictions or bilateral agreements, determined by the President to be
suitable, is in effect with respect to the United States, then the President shall proclaim the continuation of the reduction of such
rate of duty pursuant to such trade agreement. For purposes of section 109(c)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, any time when a rate
of duty existing on January 1, 1975, is in effect under this note shall be time when part of such reduction is not in effect by reason
of legislation of the United States or action thereunder.
2. The term "Certified hand-loomed and folklore" as used with respect to products provided for in the tariff schedule, refers to such
products as have been certified, in accordance with procedures established by the United States Trade Representative pursuant
to international understandings, by an official of a government agency of the country where the products were produced, to have
been so made.
Statistical Notes
1. Restraints under the Arrangement regarding International Trade in Textiles may not apply to developing country exports of
"hand-loomed and folklore products" which have been certified, in accordance with procedures established by the Committee
for the Implementation of Textile Agreements pursuant to international understandings, by an official of a government agency
of the country where the products were produced, to have been so made. The importer is required to identify such certified
products on the entry summary or withdrawal forms by placing the symbol "F" as a prefix to the appropriate 10-digit statistical
reporting number.
2. For the purposes of the Tariff Schedule:
(a) The term "subject to cotton restraints" means articles in which:
(i) The cotton component equals or exceeds 50 percent by weight of all the component fibers thereof; or
(ii) The cotton and any wool, fine animal hair or man-made fibers in the aggregate equals or exceeds 50 percent by weight
of all the component fibers thereof and the cotton component equals or exceeds the weight of each of the wool (including
fine animal hair) and man-made fiber components.
(b) The term "subject to wool restraints" means articles not provided for in (a) above and in which the wool (including fine animal
hair) component exceeds 17 percent by weight of all the component fibers thereof.
XI-7
Statistical Notes (con.)
(c) The term "subject to man-made fiber restraints" means articles not provided for in (a) or (b) above and the man-made fiber
component, or the man-made fibers and any cotton, wool or fine animal hair in the aggregate, equals or exceeds 50 percent
by weight of all the component fibers thereof.
For the application of this note, where appropriate, only the part of the product which determines the classification under general
interpretive rule 3 shall be taken into account.
3. As a convenient cross-reference, each of the textile categories (or groupings) used by the United States in monitoring shipments
of these products and to administer the United States textile trade agreements programs is listed in the schedule following the
appropriate 10-digit description.
