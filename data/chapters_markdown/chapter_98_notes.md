CHAPTER 98
SPECIAL CLASSIFICATION PROVISIONS
XXII
98-1
U.S. Notes
1. The provisions of this chapter are not subject to the rule of relative specificity in general rule of interpretation 3(a). Any article
which is described in any provision in this chapter is classifiable in said provision if the conditions and requirements thereof and
of any applicable regulations are met.
2. In the absence of a specific provision to the contrary, the tariff status of an article is not affected by the fact that it was previously
imported into the customs territory of the United States and cleared through customs whether or not duty was paid upon such
previous importation.
3. Any article exempted under subchapters IV through VII, inclusive, or subchapter IX from the payment of duty shall be exempt
also from the payment of any internal-revenue tax imposed upon or by reason of importation.
Statistical Notes
1. Statistical data are not to be furnished with respect to articles classified in those headings of this chapter for which no statistical
suffix is shown.
2. For articles provided for in this chapter, the rate of duty for which is derived from a provision elsewhere in the tariff schedule, the
citation to be used in statistical reporting shall be the 10-digit statistical reporting number provided in this chapter followed by
the reporting number of the provision from which such rate is derived. The unit of quantity reported hereunder for such articles
shall be the same as the unit of quantity for the provision from which the rate was derived. For example, 10 new fully automatic
arc welding machines exported for repairs or alterations pursuant to a warranty and returned to the United States the statistical
reporting number shall be 9802.00.4040-8515.31.0000, with the quantity being shown as 10 and the value as dutiable value.
**NOTICE TO EXPORTERS**
The statistical reporting numbers contained in this chapter
apply only to imports and may not be reported on
Shipper's Export Declarations. See Notice to Exporters
preceding chapter 1.

98-I-1
U.S. Notes
1. The provisions in this subchapter (except subheadings 9801.00.70 and 9801.00.80) shall not apply to any article:
(a) Exported with benefit of drawback;
(b) Of a kind with respect to the importation of which an internal-revenue tax is imposed at the time such article is entered,
unless such article was subject to an internal-revenue tax imposed upon production or importation at the time of its exportation
from the United States and it shall be proved that such tax was paid before exportation and was not refunded; or
(c) Manufactured or produced in the United States in a customs bonded warehouse or under heading 9813.00.05 and exported
under any provision of law.
2. For the purposes of subheadings 9801.00.70 and 9801.00.80:
(a) When because of the destruction of customs records or for other cause it is impracticable to establish whether drawback
was allowed, or the amount allowed, on a returned article, there shall be assessed thereon an amount of duty equal to the
estimated drawback and internal-revenue tax which would be allowable or refundable if the imported merchandise used in
the manufacture or production of the returned article were dutiable or taxable at the rate applicable to such merchandise on
the date of entry, but in no case more than the duty and tax that would apply if the article were wholly of foreign origin;
(b) Tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes classifiable under such subheading may be released from customs custody,
without payment of that part of duty attributable to the internal-revenue tax, for return to internal-revenue bond as provided
by section 5704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954; and
(c) In order to facilitate the ascertainment and collection of the duty provided for, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to
ascertain and specify the amounts of duty equal to drawback or internal-revenue tax which shall be applied to articles or
classes or kinds of articles, and to exempt from the assessment of duty articles or classes or kinds of articles with respect
to which the collection of such duty involves expense and inconvenience to the Government which is disproportionate to the
probable amount of such duty.
