Subheading Notes
1. In this chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:
(a) Aluminum, not alloyed
Metal containing by weight at least 99 percent of aluminum, provided that the content by weight of any other element does
not exceed the limit specified in the following table:
TABLE - Other elements
Element Limiting content percent by
weight
Fe + Si (iron plus silicon) 1
Other elements (1), each 0.1 (2)
(1) Other elements are, for example, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn.
(2) Copper is permitted in a proportion greater than 0.1 percent but not more than
0.2 percent, provided that neither the chromium nor manganese content exceeds
0.05 percent.
(b) Aluminum alloys
Metallic substances in which aluminum predominates by weight over each of the other elements, provided that:
(i) The content by weight of at least one of the other elements or of iron plus silicon taken together is greater than the limit
specified in the foregoing table; or
(ii) The total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 1 percent.
2. Notwithstanding the provisions of note 9(c) to section XV, for the purposes of subheading 7616.91 the term "wire" applies only
to products, whether or not in coils, of any cross-sectional shape, of which no cross-sectional dimension exceeds 6 mm.
Additional U.S. Note
1. For the purposes of heading 7608, the rate of duty "Free (C)" appearing in the "Special" subcolumn applies only to tubes and
pipes with attached fittings, suitable for conducting gases or liquids.
Statistical Notes
l. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "aluminum vanadium master alloy" refers to aluminum alloys which contain by weight
20 percent or more of vanadium.
2. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "aluminum can stock" refers to sheets and strip in coils, of alloys of aluminum in which
either manganese or magnesium is the predominant alloying element, not painted, over 0.175 mm but not over 0.432 mm in
thickness, and over 254 mm in width, comprising "body stock and "lid stock" as specified below:
(a) The term "body stock" refers to aluminum can stock having manganese as the predominant alloying element and having a
minimum tensile strength of 262 MPa; and
(b) The term "lid stock" refers to aluminum can stock having magnesium as the predominant alloying element and having a
minimum tensile strength of 345 MPa.
3. For the purposes of statistical reporting number 7601.20.9080, "sheet ingot" (slabs) refers to aluminum alloys with a rectangular
cross-section suitable to be manufactured into other products.

Statistical Notes (con.)
4. For the purposes of statistical reporting number 7601.20.9085, "foundry ingot" refers to large castings of aluminum alloys of
various shapes other than sheets or slabs to be melted for further processing.
5. For statistical reporting purposes under subheading 7602.00.00, the term “recyclable aluminum” refers to materials that are
obsolete, previously used, off-specification, surplus, or incidentally produced and are collected and sorted for processing into a
specification-grade commodity. Recyclable materials may also be considered as scrap but do not include solid waste or residue.
6. For the purposes of statistical reporting numbers 7604.29.3030, 7604.29.5020 and 7606.12.3015, “high-strength heat-treatable
alloys” refers to aluminum containing by weight 7.0 percent or less of copper or 10.0 percent or less of zinc, and/or are designated
as series 2xxx or 7xxx (except 7072) in the Aluminum Association’s specifications of registered alloys.
7. For the purposes of statistical reporting numbers 7604.21.0010, 7604.29.1010, 7604.29.3060, 7604.29.5050, 7606.12.3025 and
7606.12.3091, “heat-treatable industrial alloys” refers to aluminum containing by weight 3.0 percent or less of magnesium and
3.0 percent or less of silicon, and/or are designated as series 6xxx in the Aluminum Association’s specifications of registered
alloys.
