(a) For the purposes of heading 3822, the expression "certified reference materials" means reference materials which are
accompanied by a certificate which indicates the values of the certified properties, the methods used to determine these
values and the degree of certainty associated with each value and which are suitable for analytical, calibrating or referencing
purposes.
(b) With the exception of the products of chapter 28 or 29, for the classification of certified reference materials, heading 3822
shall take precedence over any other heading in the tariff schedule.
3. Heading 3824 includes the following goods which are not to be classified in any other heading of the tariff schedule:

4. Throughout the tariff schedule, "municipal waste" means waste of a kind collected from households, hotels, restaurants, hospitals,
shops, offices, etc., road and pavement sweepings, as well as construction and demolition waste. Municipal waste generally
contains a large variety of materials such as plastics, rubber, wood, paper, textiles, glass, metals, food materials, broken furniture
and other damaged or discarded articles. The term "municipal waste," does not cover:

Notes (con.)
(a) Individual materials or articles segregated from the waste, for example wastes of plastics, rubber, wood, paper, textiles,
glass or metals, electrical and electronic waste and scrap (including spent batteries) which fall in their appropriate headings
of the tariff schedule;

(c) Waste pharmaceuticals, as defined in note 4(k) to chapter 30; or
(d) Clinical waste, as defined in note 6(a), below.
5. For the purposes of heading 3825, "sewage sludge" means sludge arising from urban effluent treatment plants and includes

6. For the purposes of heading 3825, the expression "other wastes" applies to:
(a) Clinical waste, that is, contaminated waste arising from medical research, diagnosis, treatment or other medical, surgical,
dental or veterinary procedures, which often contain pathogens and pharmaceutical substances and require special disposal
procedures (for example, soiled dressings, used gloves and used syringes);
(b) Waste organic solvents;
(c) Wastes of metal pickling liquors, hydraulic fluids, brake fluids and anti-freezing fluids; and
(d) Other wastes from chemical or allied industries.
The expression "other wastes" does not, however, cover wastes which contain mainly petroleum oils or oils obtained from
bituminous materials (heading 2710).
