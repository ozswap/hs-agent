Product: "{product_description}"

Number of paths to compare: {path_count}

Here are the classification paths that were explored:

{classification_paths}

---

CHAPTER NOTES (CRITICAL - these contain precedence rules and exclusions):

{chapter_notes}

---

Task: Compare all these classification paths and select THE SINGLE BEST HS code for this product.

Important considerations:

First, check the chapter notes carefully. They contain precedence rules and exclusions that may eliminate certain paths. For example, some chapter notes explicitly exclude certain products to other chapters.

Then, evaluate each path holistically:
- Consider the complete reasoning chain from chapter to subheading
- Don't just pick the highest confidence score - look at the quality of reasoning
- Identify which path has the most compelling and defensible justification
- Look for red flags or weak justifications
- Consider which classification customs would most likely accept

Compare the paths based on:
- How precisely each HS code matches the product
- How well-justified each classification path is
- Which path has the strongest reasoning at each level
- Which classification is most defensible for customs
- Which code is most specific and practical for trade

You must provide:
- selected_code: The single best 6-digit HS code (from the explored paths), or "000000" if the description is invalid/meaningless
- confidence: Your confidence in this selection (0.0 to 1.0)
- reasoning: Detailed explanation of why this code is better than the alternatives, including what makes this path superior and what the weaknesses are in the other paths (or why the description is invalid)
- comparison_summary: Brief summary of how you compared the paths and what factors were decisive

Note: If the product description is completely invalid, meaningless, or just a test input (e.g., "test", gibberish), you may select "000000" instead of forcing a classification from the explored paths.

This is the final classification decision. Be thorough, precise, and decisive.
