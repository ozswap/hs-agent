Task: Select the best 1-{max_selections} chapter codes from these ranked candidates.

This is the foundation of the classification hierarchy, so choose carefully. Focus on quality over quantity - only select multiple chapters if there's genuine ambiguity or if they represent truly distinct classification possibilities.

For each chapter you select, provide:
- The chapter code
- A confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0
- Detailed reasoning explaining why this chapter is worth exploring further

Consider trade classification practices and choose the most accurate, defensible, and trade-compliant classifications.
