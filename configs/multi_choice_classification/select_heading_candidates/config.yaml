  quality_guidelines: |
    MAXIMIZE viable selections (aim for 3 unless clearly not justified):
    - Select all headings that could reasonably apply to this product
    - Err on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion
    - Each selection should represent a distinct classification possibility
    - Cast a wide net - we'll narrow down at the subheading stage
    - Provide detailed reasoning for each selection
    - Only exclude headings that are clearly irrelevant
