{candidates_list}

Task: Evaluate ALL chapters for relevance, but return only the most relevant chapters, ranked by relevance score (0.0 to 1.0).

Consider ALL 97 chapters during your analysis, but only return the most promising candidates. This approach:
- Evaluates the complete HS code space
- Focuses output on genuinely relevant chapters
- Reduces noise while maintaining comprehensive coverage

For each returned candidate, consider:
- The product's material composition, function, and intended use
- Multiple possible classification interpretations  
- Components or related products
- Both primary and secondary classification possibilities
- Trade classification practices and how customs typically handles similar products

Provide brief reasoning for each candidate explaining why it's relevant.
